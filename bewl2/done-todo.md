# DONE
- done_todo.md as motivator inside project, or should these notes live there?
- can protect Dot constructor?
- locally cache products, so Dot[(X, Y)] lives inside the cache for Dot[X]. Ditto exponentials
- there should really be tests for Memoize.type1 (didn't clone during refactor)

# TOO GNARLY (for now)


# TODO
- permutations, deep property of FinSet from card trick?
- argument for storing UNIT, BEWL, etc as types within the topos, not type parameters?
  Saves passing a load of baggage around. Implications for users?
- disentangle mask[]/sillyMask[] which should be a pure type operation
- asMonoid => withMonoid
- any implicits left in tests for algebraic machinery? any other unnecessary flummery with '?=>' ?
- can improve how equalizerSituation / scope of implicits works in the generic topos tests?
- convert in-code TODOs to entries here
- groups should be able to have actions
