# About GreenRees.scala with its algorithms for idempotent monoids

Algorithms based on this paper: https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/Courses/Lothaire-Ch2.pdf

This shows that the free idempotent monoid on finitely many generators is free.

I'd conjecture a higher level structure theory, specifically: 
the stronger statement that the theory of i-monoids is finitely generated, i.e. there is a
"primordial" _finite_ i-monoid of which every i-monoid is involved in some power.
This would 'explain' the local finiteness of idempotent monoids, by this result:

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3972017/how-to-show-that-that-every-finitely-generated-variety-is-locally-finite

How would one prove this? What is the primordial? Could Bewl help find it?
Is there a property of monads here waiting to be extracted?
Btw, do we know that every monad on FinSet is strong? Is there a quick proof?
What kind of topos property is this?

what are the monoliths in this variety? Guessing they have a simple structure.

One could ask also if idempotent monoids have 'enough injectives': there's a universal algebra
result characterizing this (need congruence extension property, etc etc) so maybe not.
