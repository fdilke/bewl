# Project Bewl

A DSL for the internal (Mitchell-Benabou) language of a topos. 

Bewl is an ambitious and quixotic attempt to enable new techniques for manipulating
set-like objects (permutations, musical objects, graphs, fuzzy sets, etc) as if they
were sets. This involves a mix of advanced Scala and ludicrously abstract math. The
most likely applications (still some way down the line) are to music theory or to 
the continuing quest for a proper explanation of permutation parity. It is also
possible to use Bewl as an aid to learning category theory or as a computational
algebra package where you can easily define your own algebraic structures. 

To see the current to-do list and state of play, you can view this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/PfdnsRNl/bewl). There's also a 
[continuous integration setup](https://snap-ci.com/fdilke/bewl/branch/master) which runs all the tests on each commit.

# Presentations explaining the project

Some of these are more accessible than others: pick one that's right for you.

In May 2018, I gave a talk about Bewl for [S-REPLS 9](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/srepls9/) at the University of Sussex 
([slides](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/srepls9/felixD-slides.pdf), 
[video](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/srepls9/video/felixD-presentation.mp4))
Requires some math. 

My attempt at explaining Bewl for a general audience on *cruft.io* : 
[Towards an arithmetic of sets](https://cruft.io/posts/bewl-arithmetic-of-sets)

Using Bewl to do musical calculations - 
[putting the chord of C major under the microscope](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/ChordUnderMicroscope.pdf)

Overall [state of play](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/StateOfTheBewlJan2016.pdf)
as of January 2016.

See [this presentation](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s141/sh/8e6b9d94-bc20-4fde-b2bf-9e844f486f76/d11244bad0729071fa00d19eaad312ce)
for an attempt at "the internal language for dummies"

I've had to keep re-implementing Bewl in successively more powerful programming languages (Java, Clojure and now Scala). 
Now learning [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/), which is an amazing language and may be
the next logical step.

[This presentation](http://prezi.com/dwrz2mft3y-g/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) explains the new "intrinsic" Bewl 2.0 DSL and why it's better than the previous "diagrammatic" 1.0 one.

Here's a presentation about Bewl's [universal algebra capabilities](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/BewlUniversalAlgebra.pdf).

This [animated video](http://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=nUwjGBHXKYs) was an initial attempt to explain Bewl (back when it was called Bile)

# Parity

[This presentation](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/DoubleExponentialMonads.pdf) describes
my simplistic but ambitious plan to solve the mystery of permutation parity by calculating the double exponential
monad for Â¬, the permutation interchanging true and false. 
Here's one about the [topos of automorphisms](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/ToposOfAutomorphisms.pdf), 
another chapter in the ongoing parity quest. Here's an
[update](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/PartyingWithPermutations.pdf).
(Since then, I've decided it would be easier to generalize the transfer using the 
theory of Coxeter groups, but that's another story.)

# Music

[Here I relate](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/BewlSpeedup.pdf) Bewl to [Thomas Noll's paper](http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~noll/ToposOfTriads.pdf) about music theory and topoi 

# Category theory tutorials

Refresher on [strong monads](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/notes/StrongMonads.pdf).

If you want to use Bewl as a learning aid to study category theory, [start here](https://github.com/fdilke/bewl/blob/master/CommandLine.md).

# Intended applications

- Explore music theory via the triadic topos (see [The Topos of Music](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-8141-8))
- Explore parity in other topoi (as it's so poorly understood for sets). Easier now that the
"topos of permutations" is implemented.
- Explore the topos of graphs. Bewl will let us talk about graphs as if they were sets
- Explore fuzzy sets (using the more careful definition that makes them into a topos)
- Explore Lawvere-Tierney topologies (and perhaps save [these](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/VIGRE2007/REUPapers/FINALFULL/Bartlett.pdf) music theorists from having to calculate them by hand)

# Done so far

- Created Topos API as a trait
- Implemented FiniteSets as a topos
- Added 'generic topos tests' which use fixtures for the given topos
- Can define and verify algebraic laws. Only 'monotyped' laws as yet - can't define monoid and ring actions 
- compact notation for elements / lambdas / uniform operators
- adapter for diagrammatic layer
- Separated BaseTopos from its extra layers (Algebra, AlgebraicStructures) which are now traits
- Universal and existential quantifiers
- Strong binding: a new layer with stars/quivers concreting over dots/arrows ; stars bound to classes ; quivers/functions interchangeable
- Specialized element types: e.g. product has left, right ; exponential can apply
- Adapter that makes a dots-and-arrows topos look like a stars-and-quivers one
- Implementation of FiniteSets using new DSL
- Defined quantifiers in new DSL
- Construct the initial object 0
- Coproducts
- predicates isMonic, isEpic, isIso
- enumerate morphisms / global elements
- Partial arrow classifier
- walkthrough for using Bewl as a learning aid for studying category theory [NEEDS UPDATING]
- universal algebra: can define algebraic structures, using existing ones as parameter spaces (for monoid actions)
- implemented topos of monoid actions
- implemented topos of automorphisms
- traits for monads and strong monads
- implement double-exponential (continuation) monad
- endow the subobject classifier with a Heyting algebra structure
- removed legacy DiagrammaticTopos code
- images
- quotients and lifts
- more algebraic structures: now include all the classical ones
- coequalizers

# To do

- construct the monad of monoid actions
- construct the reader monad 
- construct 'pitchfork' for algebras over a strong monad
- construct 'pitchfork' for 'informal' (operator) algebras
- construct the topos of coalgebras, and so (maybe a slow implementation of) the slice topos
- Can extend and remap algebraic structures, e.g. ring extends abelian group remaps group with an extra law
- More algebraic constructions: endomorphism ring, transfer
- separate out the language, have an independent first-order grammar, in which there can be proofs?
- have a concept of 'models' and streamline construction constellation/scalars
- language in which class ::== a theory
- implicit objects, follow Odersky concept of 'context' used in Dotty
- make =?= be a binary operation on (extra rich) elements 
- tell if an object has an injective hull
- Optimize algorithm enough to construct triadic topos and its topologies
- Construct the slice topos. Use McLarty's construction, NOT the one in Moerdijk/Maclane which
requires you to first construct the power object for exponentials
