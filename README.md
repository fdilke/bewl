# Bewl
# ====

A DSL for the internal (Mitchell-Benabou) language of a topos.

Here's an [animated video](http://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=nUwjGBHXKYs) which gives a gentle introduction to Project Bewl (formerly Bile)

# Done so far

Created Topos API as a trait
Implemented FiniteSets as a topos
Added 'generic topos tests' which use fixtures for the given topos

# To do

Allow definition of algebraic structures with laws. Define group, ring, etc
Broaden definition of algebraic structures to include models and parameterized operations
Formalize constructions like: automorphism group, endomorphism ring, group of invertible elements of a monoid
Extract the Heyting algebra structure of the subobject classifier
