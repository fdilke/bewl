<h2>... so let's write a program to generate them</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I've been trying to learn Idris, a somewhat bleeding-edge programming language which is like Haskell but more so</p></li>
<li><p>I (wrongly) decided I understood it well enough to try writing a program to generate mazes</p></li>
<li><p>The hard things turned out to be simple, but the simple things were hard...</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="the-mission" class="slide level2">
<h2>The mission</h2>
<p>How about a maze that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/my-maze.png" id="id" class="class" width="300" height="300" /><br />
</p>
<p>Let's output this in text mode using quarter-square graphics.</p>
<p>Once the basic algorithm is done, it can scale up to do bigger and badder mazes.</p>

</section>
<section id="how-do-you-generate-a-maze" class="slide level2">
<h2>How do you generate a maze?</h2>
<p>Abstracting away the irrelevant details, the structure of the maze is:</p>
<p><img src="images/skeleton-maze.jpg" id="id" class="class" width="300" height="300" /><br />
It's a rectangular grid of cells with connections added between adjacent cells to form a <em>tree</em>.</p>

</section>
<section id="trees---a-concept-from-graph-theory" class="slide level2">
<h2>Trees - a concept from graph theory</h2>
<p><img src="images/about-trees.png" id="id" class="class" width="600" height="200" /><br />
A <em>tree</em> is a graph with just enough edges to make it one piece, or, equivalently, as many edges as possible without forming a circuit.</p>
<p>Poetically, a graph consisting of a bunch of trees is called a <em>forest</em>.</p>

</section>
<section id="compsci-description-of-the-problem" class="slide level2">
<h2>CompSci description of the problem</h2>
<p>Given a rectangular grid of cells, make it into a graph by connecting every pair of adjacent cells with an edge.</p>
<p>We have to find a <em>spanning forest</em> of this graph.</p>
<p>This is pretty simple: you just accumulate a list of edges, only adding ones that don't create a circuit.</p>

</section>
<section id="but-if-you-do-that..." class="slide level2">
<h2>But if you do that...</h2>
<p><img src="images/boring-maze.jpg" id="id" class="class" width="200" height="200" /><br />
Not an acceptable solution: the same boring maze each time.</p>
<p>We have to introduce randomness, i.e. present the edges in a random order.</p>
<p>Absurdly, this was the hardest part of the project.</p>

</section>
<section id="skating-lightly-over-the-algorithm" class="slide level2">
<h2>Skating lightly over the algorithm</h2>
<p>Here it is, anyway:</p>
<p><img src="images/spanning-forest.png" id="id" class="class" width="600" height="400" /><br />
This was hard too, but in a good way.</p>

</section>
<section id="let-me-unpack-that-for-you" class="slide level2">
<h2>Let me unpack that for you</h2>
<p>It's basically just a fold - accumulating a list of edges - but you have to efficiently keep track of which cells are connected.</p>
<p>You also have to use the right data structures in Idris, and figure out how to test-drive it... all of which took a while.</p>

</section>
<section id="debugging-the-mazes" class="slide level2">
<h2>Debugging the mazes</h2>
<p><img src="images/mangled-maze.jpg" id="id" class="class" width="400" height="300" /><br />
After staring at this for hours, I realized that the bottom and right edges were mangled because of a fencepost error (easily fixed)</p>
<p>Also the randomizer wasn't working properly. But all it had to do was shuffle the list of edges...?</p>

</section>
<section id="why-is-randomness-so-hard" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why is randomness so hard?</h2>
<p><img src="images/roulette-wheel.png" id="id" class="class" width="400" height="300" /><br />
It isn't functional! A function that returns random numbers isn't allowed in Idris because it can return a different value on every call, violating the semantics. Same goes for calculating the date and time.</p>

</section>
<section id="into-the-dark-heart-of-the-effects-monad" class="slide level2">
<h2>Into the dark heart of the effects monad</h2>
<p>You have to generate random numbers in the context of a special monad, and use the Effects library to get it to interoperate with all the other monads you have to use for anything else that is not strictly functional...Yes, I know this is why not everyone would want to use languages like Idris.</p>
<p>Also, it turned out there was a <em>bug</em> in the run time library which was interacting adversely with the perhaps overcomplicated &quot;Godel numbering scheme for permutations&quot; I had decided to use, which was fun to implement but not, as it turned out, practical.</p>

</section>
<section id="the-solution..." class="slide level2">
<h2>The solution...</h2>
<p>... was to look up &quot;generating uniformly random permutations&quot; on Wikipedia which tells you to use the Knuth shuffle.</p>
<p>But even that is hard! The algorithm involves swapping successive pairs of elements in an array to generate the permutation by composing transpositions. And that's non-functional - arrays are not mutable in Idris.</p>
<p>I managed to write a recursive algorithm to do it by disassembling and recombining the array, but it was very slow for mazes of any size.</p>

</section>
<section id="optimizing-the-shuffle" class="slide level2">
<h2>Optimizing the shuffle</h2>
<p>I searched the web to find out how Haskellers get round this problem, and it turns out they do it by using a special hack to mutate the array, because Haskell is a more mature (and possibly more pragmatic) language than Idris.</p>
<p>I conjecture that generating random permutations in an efficient yet functionally pure way should be achievable, but for now, this seems to be the stuff of CompSci PhD theses.</p>

</section>
<section id="an-expedient-hack" class="slide level2">
<h2>An expedient hack</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, here is my not-too-chronically-slow compromise solution:</p>
