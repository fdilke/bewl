## About me, Felix Dilke

- I'm a software developer on SpringerLink
(link.springer.com)

- Also an amateur mathematician

- Bewl is my 10% time project at Springer Nature

- It involves ludicrously high-level math, which I'll try to 
skate over lightly in this talk

- I wrote it in Java, then Clojure, then Scala

- Bewl is test-driven Scala code, open source on GitHub
