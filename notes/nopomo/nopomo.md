Amusing Ourselves to Death, 1986

"The medium is the message": What happens when
public discourse is crammed into a TV format?

Edutainment. The TV curriculum:
- no prerequisites
Education withour sequence or continuity

- no perplexity
The contentment, not the growth, of the learner is paramount.

- no exposition
Arguments, hypotheses, discussions, reasons? Meh.

Non-example: Dilbert and other cartoons memorably
described by Calvin as "Xeroxed talking heads"

Another non-example: "An Inconvenient Truth"
Science, or propaganda?

Uncomfortably: most people (even scientists)
don't understand stats well enough to design or validate
experiments.

perception is reality
rebuttal database
uh-oh, meh, burn! "oO" vs <shrug>

We need a vocabulary

framing: who moved my cheese

Not about what it's about
About how it is about it
Screenplays are structure

Kayfabe: multiple levels of (un)reality in WWF

Unreliable narrator
Abstract nunneries
Casino: deliberately unsettling because of voice over to
cornfield scene: can't describe event retrospectively

He owns the room:
Due process vs Court of public opinion / BTV morality

Essence of humour:
relief as the fear recedes that some
epistemic bad analogy was about to be forcibly imposed

Cleggbook
The Nazi-Soviet moment when the joke candidate wins
(The Apprentice: interruption, Conditions you he's the boss.
Even a credible businessman was a stretch)
Ukrainian TV prez, actor wins election

Downloadable moralities
Custom audiences

Art as ambiguity
The 100 Acre Wood = heaven and hell, simultaneously
Place of genesis. See also: basement of eggs

De Niro doing La Motta doing Brando doing xxx
Retroactive continuity

Delaminated media: Peppa Pig, only she's sawing
Batman in half, drinking bleach or eating her father.

De-positioning: Kara Swisher has great hair (non-example?)

Theory of humour: When the terrifying possibility of
epistemic warfare (baking in bad assumptions) is averted

"If you can't explain it to a 6 year old, 
you don't understand it"
May well be an axiom of pop science

Sapir-Whorf: language moulds thought.

The Guardians: You can only do anything as part of a crowd
MORE superstitious and gullible than mediaeval peasants.
Who started mass protests when the calendar changed,
thinking they were losing 11 days from their lives. (Ref?)

reality based community:
Your job is to turn our narrative into history

cf Eich, terms of debate, something can be a topic of
discussion in 1996 (?) but not 2006 (?)

Flat earthism a point of view
It's a thing
Hey, believers in XX are people too
Note from 'diversity' propaganda leaflet
But you know what he means, right?

Good:

accountability
propositional logic
When you say...
Due process
Established profession (maybe)
Munger's list of biases

Instead:
The customer has been told...
White coat for credibility
Go on, give us a click
Peer pressure
Appeal to Authority
Implicit assumptions
Controlling the narrative
Keeping the conversation on the rails
